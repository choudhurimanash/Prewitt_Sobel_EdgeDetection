# Edge detection in **Image Processing**

Edge detection is an image-processing technique, which is used to identify the boundaries (edges) of objects, or regions within an image. Edges are among the most important features associated with images. We come to know of the underlying structure of an image through its edges. Computer vision processing pipelines therefore extensively use edge detection in applications.

## _How are Edges Detected?_

Edges are characterized by sudden changes in pixel intensity. To detect edges, we need to go looking for such changes in the neighboring pixels.

## Steps to be follow-

- install OpenCV `pip install opencv-python`
- install numpy  `pip install numpy`
